# Lokomotive <img align="right" width=384 src="docs/images/lokomotive-logo.svg">

Lokomotive is an open source Kubernetes distribution that ships pure upstream
Kubernetes.
It focuses on being minimal, easy to use, and secure by default.

Lokomotive is fully self-hosted and includes [Lokomotive
Components](https://kinvolk.io/docs/lokomotive/latest/concepts/components) adding essential functionality for production
not shipped with upstream Kubernetes.
