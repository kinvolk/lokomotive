This section shows how to perform a release of Lokomotive. Only parts of the
procedure are automated; this is somewhat intentional (manual steps for sanity
checking) but it can probably be further scripted.

We use goreleaser to automate some parts of the release, follow [the
instructions](https://goreleaser.com/install/) to get it installed on your
local machine.

The following example assumes we’re going from version 0.1.0 (`v0.1.0`) to
0.2.0 (`v0.2.0`). Check [Increasing version number](#increasing-version-number)
for details on how to identify what the next version should be.

- Start at the relevant milestone on GitHub (e.g.
  https://github.com/kinvolk/lokomotive/milestones/v0.2.0): ensure all
  referenced issues are closed or moved elsewhere. Close the milestone.

- Create a release branch from latest master
  - e.g. `git fetch origin && git checkout -b user/release-v0.2.0 origin/master`

- Make sure your git status is clean.

- Ensure the build is clean
  - `git clean -ffdx && make all` should work.
  - CI should be green.

- Follow manual [checklist](./checklist) before making a release and ensure everything works fine.

- Update the [release notes](https://github.com/kinvolk/lokomotive/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). Try to capture most of the salient
  changes since the last release, but don't go into unnecessary detail (better
  to link/reference the documentation wherever possible).
  `scripts/changelog.sh` will help generating an initial list of changes.
  Correct/fix entries if necessary, and group them by category.

- Update [installation guide](../installer/lokoctl) to reference to new
  version.

Even though it is set at build time, the Lokomotive version is also hardcoded
in the repository, so the first thing to do is bump it:

- Run `scripts/bump-release.sh v0.2.0`. This should generate two commits: a bump
  to the actual release (e.g. v0.2.0, including CHANGELOG updates), and then a
  bump to the release+git (e.g. v0.2.0+git). The actual release version should
  only exist in a single commit! Sanity check what the script did with `git
  diff HEAD^^` or similar.

- If the script didn't work, yell at the author and/or fix it. It can almost certainly be improved.

- File a PR and get a review from another maintainer. This is useful to a)
  sanity check the diff, and b) be very explicit/public that a release is
  happening.

- Ensure the CI on the release PR is green!

- Merge the PR.

Now we'll tag the release.

- Check out the release commit: `git checkout HEAD^` should work. You want to
  be at the commit where the version is without "+git". Sanity check
  `pkg/version/version.go`.

- Create a signed tag. Check [Release signing](#release-signing) for details.
  - `git tag -a v0.2.0 -s -m "Release v0.2.0"`

- Push the tag to git.
  - `git push --tags origin v0.2.0`

- Export your GitHub token (check [Getting a GitHub API token](#getting-a-github-api-token) for details).
  - `export GITHUB_TOKEN=<GitHub token>`

- Export your GPG Key Signature. Find your signature in the [Trusted keys](../keys).
  - `export GPG_FINGERPRINT=<GPG Signature>`

- Build the binary, sign it, upload it to GitHub, create draft GitHub release.
  - `make build-and-publish-release`

- Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/kinvolk/lokomotive/releases) and
  check everything looks good.

- Use the GitHub UI to publish the release.

- Clean your git tree.
  - `git clean -ffdx`

## Increasing version number

This attempts to describe how to decide what kind of release to do.

### Patch release

Patch release version should be increased, if the planned release:

- contains only bug fixes and improvements

That means, if the current latest version is `1.2.3`, it should be increased to `1.2.4`.

### Minor release

Minor release version should be increased if the planned release either:

- contains new features and does not include breaking changes

- includes breaking changes, but it’s done before `1.0.0` release

That means, if the current latest version is `1.2.3`, it should be increased to `1.3.0`.

### Major release

Major release version should be increased if the planned release either:

- contains breaking changes

- contains major improvements

That means, if the current latest version is `1.2.3`, it should be increased to `2.0.0`.

## Getting a GitHub API token

goreleaser uses the GitHub API to create a release and upload release
artifacts, so you need to have valid GitHub API token exported as an
environment variable before running it.

To create a new API token, visit
[https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

## Release signing

Each Lokomotive release must be signed by a trusted GPG key.

### Generating new GPG key

Please follow [Generating a new GPG
key](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-gpg-key)
for generating new keys for signing.

## Adding new GPG key to list of trusted keys

Before signing a release with a new GPG key, it should be signed by other trusted
keys and added to the [list of trusted keys in the repository](../keys).
