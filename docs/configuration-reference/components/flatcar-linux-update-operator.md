## Introduction

This component is a controller that manages node reboots for nodes running Flatcar Container Linux
images. When a reboot is needed after updating the system via
[update_engine](https://github.com/coreos/update_engine), the operator will drain the node before
rebooting it.


## Prerequisites

* A Lokomotive cluster accessible via `kubectl`.

## Configuration

This component does not require any specific configuration.

An empty configuration block is also accepted as valid configuration.

Flatcar Container Linux update operator component configuration example:

```tf
component "flatcar-linux-update-operator" {}
```

In some cases, you would want to prevent a certain node from rebooting by the operator. To do that:

```bash
kubectl label nodes NODENAME flatcar-linux-update.v1.flatcar-linux.net/reboot-pause=true
```
