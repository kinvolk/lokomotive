## Introduction

This configuration reference provides information on configuring a Lokomotive cluster on Packet with all
the configuration options available to the user.

## Prerequisites

* `lokoctl` [installed locally.](../../installer/lokoctl.md)
* `kubectl` installed locally to access the Kubernetes cluster.

### Configuration

To create a Lokomotive cluster, we need to define a configuration.

Example configuration file:

```tf
# mycluster.lokocfg
variable "packet_token" {}
variable "asset_dir" {}
variable "facility" {}
variable "cluster_name" {}
variable "controllers_count" {}
variable "workers_count" {}
variable "controller_type" {}
variable "workers_type" {}
variable "dns_zone" {}
variable "route53_zone_id" {}
variable "packet_project_id" {}
variable "ssh_public_keys" {}
variable "management_cidrs" {}
variable "node_private_cidr" {}
variable "state_s3_bucket" {}
variable "lock_dynamodb_table" {}

backend "s3" {
  bucket         = var.state_s3_bucket
  key            = var.state_s3_key
  region         = var.state_s3_region
  dynamodb_table = var.lock_dynamodb_table
}

# backed "local" {
#   path = "path/to/local/file"
#}

cluster "packet" {
  auth_token = var.packet_token

  asset_dir = var.asset_dir

  cluster_name = var.cluster_name

  controller_count = var.controllers_count

  controller_type = "baremetal_0"

  facility = var.facility

  os_channel = "stable"

  os_version = "current"

  os_arch = "amd64"

  ipxe_script_url = ""

  project_id = var.packet_project_id

  dns {
    zone = var.dns_zone

    provider {
      route53 {
        zone_id = var.route53_zone_id
      }
    }

    # manual {}
  }

  ssh_pubkeys = var.ssh_public_keys

  management_cidrs = var.management_cidrs

  node_private_cidr = var.node_private_cidr

  cluster_domain_suffix = "cluster.local"

  network_mtu = 1480

  tags {
    key1 = "value1"
    key2 = "value2"
  }

  enable_aggregation = true

  enable_reporting = false

  network_ip_autodetection_method = "first-found"

  pod_cidr = "10.2.0.0/16"

  service_cidr = "10.3.0.0/16"

  reservation_ids = { controller-0 = "55555f20-a1fb-55bd-1e11-11af11d11111" }

  reservation_ids_default = ""

  certs_validity_period_hours = 8760

  worker_pool "worker-pool-1" {
    count = var.workers_count

    ipxe_script_url = ""

    os_arch = "amd64"

    disable_bgp = false

    node_type = var.workers_type

    os_channel = "stable"

    os_version = "current"

    labels = "foo=bar,baz=zab"

    taints = "nodeType=storage:NoSchedule"

    setup_raid = false

    setup_raid_hdd = false

    setup_raid_ssd = false

    setup_raid_ssd_fs = false
  }
}
```

**NOTE**: Should you feel differently about the default values, you can set default values using the `variable`
block in the cluster configuration.

Example:

The default for node_type is `baremetal_0`. If you wish to change the default, then you
define the variable  and use it to refer in the cluster configuration.

```tf
variable "custom_default_worker_type" {
  default = "c2.medium.x86"
}

.
.
.
node_type = var.custom_default_worker_type
.
.
.

```

## Applying

To create the cluster, execute the following command:

```console
lokoctl cluster apply
```

## Destroying

To destroy the Lokomotive cluster, execute the following command:

```console
lokoctl cluster destroy --confirm
```

## ARM support and hybrid clusters

Lokomotive and Flatcar currently include an alpha-quality preview for the
Packet arm64 server type `c2.large.arm`. They can be used for both worker and
controller nodes. Besides specifying them in `controller_type`/`node_type` you
need to configure some additional variables in the respective controller/worker
module:

```
os_arch = "arm64"
os_channel = "alpha"
ipxe_script_url = "https://alpha.release.flatcar-linux.net/arm64-usr/current/flatcar_production_packet.ipxe"
```

The iPXE boot variable can be removed once Flatcar is available for
installation in the Packet OS menu for the ARM servers.

If you have a hybrid cluster with both x86 and ARM nodes, you need to either
use Docker multiarch images such as the standard `debian:latest` or
`python:latest` images, or restrict Pods to nodes of the correct architecture
with an entry like this for ARM (or with `amd64` for x86) in your YAML
deployment:

```
nodeSelector:
  kubernetes.io/arch: arm64
```

An example on how to build multiarch images yourself is
[here](https://github.com/kinvolk/calico-hostendpoint-controller/#building).

**Note**: [Lokomotive Components](../../concepts/components.md) are not
supported in this preview, so if you need them you'll have to install them
manually using Kubernetes directly.
